# Modeling Quadcopter

Modeling Quadcopte is a project on developing a mathematical model of a quadcopter based on control theory and dynamics. Moreover deep learning neural network algorithm (Alexnet) is used for obstacle detection and avoidance in the simulation environment.

## How to use?
If you are fond of mathematical modeling and want to work with controllers, you can clone this project using the command:

> git clone https://github.com/arjunvijayanathakurup/Modeling-Quadcopter.git

## Resource
All the information regarding the project have been recorded in the [Modeling Quacopter.pdf](https://github.com/arjunvijayanathakurup/Modeling-Quadcopter/blob/master/Modeling%20Quadcopter.pdf) file and the reference can be found in [Teppo's paper](https://github.com/arjunvijayanathakurup/Modeling-Quadcopter/blob/master/Modellingandcontrolofquadcopter.pdf)

## Basic Requirements
* Matlab R2019a or higher
* Simulink
* Aerospace Blockset
* Deep learning tool box
* Alexnet(optional)
* controller tool box
* V-Realm software (CAD editing and producing .wrl file for the animation)

## Working on the project
The `teppo.slx` file is the original simulink file containing all the scripts, model, classical controller and the learning based controller. One can start working on it by opening the file in Simulink.
